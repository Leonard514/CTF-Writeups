# Challenge Approach

To begin the challenge, I looked up a [youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/0DQnWalxYb4?list=PLmqenIp2RQciV955S2rqGAn2UOrR2NX-v) about XXE Injection. After watching the video for a bit, I found that XXE injection seeks to modify XML code sent to a website (in a POST request) to inject code to include a file on the website. This can be seen in [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DQnWalxYb4&list=PLmqenIp2RQciV955S2rqGAn2UOrR2NX-v&index=29) of the tutorial. After watching the video, I performed an identical XXE attack on the given website. The required POST request (to send to Burp's repeater) can be generated by clicking any of the three buttons at the bottom of the information boxes.
