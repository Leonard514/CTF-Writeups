## Solution approach
You may want to see my writeup from c0rrupt (pico2019), since I approached this challenge immediately after completing that challenge. The same background from there applies here...
- The magic bytes for PNG files are right [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)
- This [site](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html) explains how PNG files work
- [hexed.it](hexed.it) allows you to change files on the web (or you can use **hexedit** if you prefer)
- [This site](https://www.nayuki.io/page/png-file-chunk-inspector) allows you to check out what's wrong with your png file (or you can use **pngcheck** if you prefer - though the website is much more informative about what's wrong with your file)

I used the provided websites more. Anyways, let's open up the file
