## Solution Process

I opened the file in audacity and found the morse code in the file. I inputted the morse code into this [morse code decryptor](https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/morse-code/), taking care to insert the underscores for the extra long pauses. After the morse code is decrypted, that's your flag. A short and simple challenge.
