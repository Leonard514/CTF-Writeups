# Repository Description

These are just personal writeups for CTFs that I solve. I'm currently learning the ropes, so you'll be seeing lots of stuff from picogym at the moment. How I usually do these writeups is I go over the process behind getting the flag, though I never place the flag itself in the writeup (this prevents people from coming just to copy-paste the flag and ignoring the rest of my writeup). If there is a CTF problem which took many hours to solve, I will streamline the writeup (since I inevitably pulled up irrelevant resources and dead ends).
