### Notes for Linux Fundamentals
- Random paths (ex: to a mail directory) may be stored in the environment variables, utilize **env** for this one
- MTU is the maximum transmission unit, or the largest packet size. It can be found utilizing **ifconfig**
- Remember to read manual pages
- **ls -al** works as usual, apparently files have indexes (otherwise known as inodes) stored in a system table. You can view them utilizing the **-i** flag. You can also utilize the **-t** flag to sort by last time modified
- **cd** apparently has a **-** option to cd into the previous directory
- There are some keyboard shortcuts. **CTRL + L** quickly clears the screen, while **CTRL + R** allows for searching the command history for a specific command
- **mkdir** has a **-p** flag that allows for making multiple directories at a time (ex: **mkdir -p CIS_3213/Week_1_Work**
- There is a **tree** command that allows for displaying a file tree
- For **mv** and **cp**, you can specify multiple files. If you specify a directory as the last parameter, you move or copy the files into that directory
- For **find**, there are many options for filetype, filename, owner, filesize, last edit date, etc. Here it is below:

- `find / -type f -name *.conf -user root -size +20k -newermt 2020-03-03 -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null`

| **Option** | **Description** |
| - | - |
| `-type f` | Hereby, we define the type of the searched object. In this case, 'f' stands for 'file'. |
| `-name *.conf` | With '-name', we indicate the name of the file we are looking for. The asterisk (*) stands for 'all' files with the '.conf' extension. |
| `-user root` | This option filters all files whose owner is the root user. | 
| `-size +20k` | We can then filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20 KiB. |
| `-newermt 2020-03-03` | With this option, we set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented. |
| `-exec ls -al {} \;` | This option executes the specified command, using the curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backslash escapes the next character from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would terminate the command and not reach the redirection. |
| `2>/dev/null` | This is a STDERR redirection to the 'null device', which we will come back to in the next section. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must not be an option of the 'find' command. |

- Note to self: Be sure to put any redirection commands a space from anything previous
- There are file descriptors, which are indicators of connections for input/output operations. STDIN is 0, STDOUT is 1, STDERR is 2. You can redirect any of these streams to a file (or /dev/null to get rid of it). For example, if we wanted to direct command output to a file log.txt and errors to another file, we would do `<command> 2>error.txt 1>log.txt`. You can also use just `>` to redirect all remaining output (which may include normal output and errors)
- To redirect to standard input, utilize `<`. For example, `cat < stdout.txt` redirects contents of stdout.txt as STDIN.
- We know about using `>` to overwrite and `>>` to append. Apparently `<<` makes a stream from a file to add to standard input - this ends through an `EOF` (End-Of-File) function.
- **Piping** allows direction of standard output as input to another program. `grep` allows for text filtering, while `wc` allows to count the number of words (or lines, or anything really)
- You can read files via `more` (which leaves text on the terminal) and `less` (which doesn't, but has more options). There's also the typical `head` and `tail`. `sort` sorts the output alphabetically (likely by ASCII value)
- You can utilize `grep` to filter results, the `-v` flag allows for an inverted search
- `cut` splits text by delimeter. Utilize the `-d"<delimiter>"` flag to specify the delimiter and `-f<index_list>` to define which 1-indexed element to access
- `tr` replaces all instances (within the input) of the first string argument with the second string argument
- `column -t` will make tabular columns of output

From this point on I realized it would be better to utilize a tabular format of examples and explanations

| Example | Explanation |
| - | - |
| `cat /etc/passwd \| grep -v "false\\|nologin" \| tr ":" " " \| column -t  \| awk '{print $1, $NF}' \| sed 's/bin/HTB/g' \| wc -l` | Display text of /etc/passwd. Exclude lines with "false" or "nologin", then replace colons with spaces, then display columns in tabular form. Then, only show the first and last columns. Then, substitute 's' bin for HTB (g replaces all matches). Then, display the number of lines (number of matches) |
| `cat /etc/passwd \| grep cry0l1t3` | Display the cry0l1t3 line in /etc/passwd |
| `cat /etc/passwd \| cut -d":" -f1` | Cut /etc/passwd by delimiter :, display first field only (usernames) |
| `cat /etc/passwd \| grep cry0l1t3 \| cut -d":" -f1,3` | Print /etc/passwd, printing only the line with cry0l1t3. Cut by colons and display fields 1 and 3 (the username and uid) |
| `cat /etc/passwd \| grep cry0l1t3 \| cut -d":" -f1,3 \| sed 's/:/,/g'` | Same as above, but all colons replaced with commas |
| `cat /etc/passwd \| tr ":" " " \| column -t \| awk '{print $1, $3, $NF}' \| tr " " ","` | Print /etc/passwd. Replace all colons with spaces. Arrange output tabularly. Then, include only the first, third, and last columns (username, uid, and shell). Replace spaces with commas for csv output. |
| `cat /etc/passwd \| tr ":" " " \| column -t \| awk '{print $1, $3, $NF}' \| tr " " "," \| grep -v "nologin\\|false" ` | Same as above, but excluding lines with nologin or false |
| `cat /etc/passwd \| tr ":" " " \| column -t \| awk '{print $1, $3, $NF}' \| tr " " "," \| grep -v "nologin" \| wc -l` | Similar to above, but only excluding nologin lines this time. Also the output is the number of lines (number of matching users) |


### [Regex Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-regular-expressions/)

To apply these, utilize the -E option in grep
| **Operators** | **Description** |
| - | - |
| `(a)` | The round brackets are used to group parts of a regex. Within the brackets, you can define further patterns which should be processed together. |
| `\[a-z\]` | The square brackets are used to define character classes. Inside the brackets, you can specify a list of characters to search for. |
| `{1,10}` | The curly brackets are used to define quantifiers. Inside the brackets, you can specify a number or a range that indicates how often a previous pattern should be repeated. |
| `\|` | Also called the OR operator and shows results when one of the two expressions matches |
| `.*` | Operates similarly to an AND operator by displaying results only when both expressions are present and match in the specified order |
| `.` | Wildcard character, can be any character |
| `*` | Repeat previous character 0 or more times |
| `^` and `$` | The beginning and end of a string respectively |
| `grep -E "(my\|false)" /etc/passwd` | Grep for all lines containing my OR false in /etc/passwd |
| `grep -E "(my.*false)" /etc/passwd` | Grep for all lines containing my AND false in /etc/passwd |

- Regarding directory permissions, execute permissions are required to traverse; write permissions are required to make, delete, rename files/subdirectories

| Example | Explanation |
| - | - |
| `chmod a+r shell && ls -l shell` | Adds read permissions for all three groups and displays permissions |
| `chmod 754 shell && ls -l shell` | Gives owner all perms, group read and execute, and others read perms. Display perms |
| `chown root:root shell && ls -l shell` | Makes the root user and root group the owner of a file. Display this change |

- Set User ID and Set Group ID bits allow people to run files as other users/groups, and is dangerous as a route for privilege escalation
- The sticky bit ensures that only the owner user or root can delete or rename files. In `ls -l`, a lowercase t means execute permissions are enabled for other users and uppercase T means execute permissions are disabled for other users.
- Regarding packages the Advanced Package Manager (APT) handles dependencies and the sources can often be found in `/etc/apt/sources.list/` or `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`. APT also provides caching of package information


| Example | Explanation |
| - | - |
| `apt-cache search <keyword>` | Searches APT cache - if you put the name of a package, it gives information about that package. |
| `apt list --installed` | Lists installed packages |
| `sudo apt install impacket-scripts -y` | installs package |
| `mkdir ~/nishang/ && git clone https://github.com/samratashok/nishang.git ~/nishang ` | Makes a directory and clones into it |
| `wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/strace/strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb` | Downloads a package strace from URL |
| `sudo dpkg -i strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb` | Installs from .deb file via dpkg |
| `systemctl start ssh` | Starts the OpenSSH Service |
| `systemctl status ssh` | View information about OpenSSH |
| `systemctl enable ssh` | Add OpenSSH to a SysV service script, which runs SSH on startup |
| `ps -aux \| grep ssh` | View the process running OpenSSH |
| `systemctl list-units --type=service` | List all services |
| `journalctl -u ssh.service --no-pager` | View OpenSSH service error logs |
